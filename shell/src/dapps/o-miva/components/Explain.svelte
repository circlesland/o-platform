        Why?
        Minerva Wallet is a great crypto and identity wallet
        and plans to integrate Circles UBI. Have a look at the Minerva Wallet website and test it yourself.
        How does it work?
        You send part or all of your Circles to the given
        address and your share of MIVA tokens will be streamed to your account. More details in our blog post, here.
        What is MIVA?
        MIVA is the utility token of the Minerva Wallet and
        more about the tokenomics and use cases can be found here. It can be continuously streamed between accounts and it is currently traded on Honeyswap.
